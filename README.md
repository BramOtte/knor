# Knor

Knor, a simple synthesis tool for HOA parity automata

**Currently implemented features**:
- parser for eHOA based on [HOA-TOOLS](https://github.com/gaperez64/hoa-tools/) by [Guillermo Perez](https://github.com/gaperez64/)
- BDD-based splitting of the parity automaton into a parity game using [Sylvan](https://github.com/trolando/sylvan/)
- solving the parity game using [Oink](https://github.com/trolando/oink/)

Knor does not yet support synthesizing the controller, and only computes whether or not the controller is realizable.

## Usage

Compile Knor using the following command line:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Dependencies include `flex` and `bison` to generate the eHOA parser, and `boost` for Oink.

Use `knor --help` to get a list of parameters.
The option `--naive` selects the naive splitting procedure, which is not recommended but possible for the purpose of comparing it with the BDD-based procedure.
If you use `--print-game` then Knor will not solve the game and instead print the parity game to standard output.
With `-v` or `--verbose`, Knor will write some information to standard error, such as the time it takes for each step of the process.
Furthermore, you can select a solver for the parity game solving, e.g., `--npp`, `--fpi`, `--fpj` are recommended solvers.
See further the documentation of [Oink](https://github.com/trolando/oink/).
If invoked without a filename, Knor will attempt to read an eHOA file from `stdin`.

## Extended HOA

HOA is the [Hanoi Omega Automata](http://adl.github.io/hoaf/) file format that supports finite automata for languages on infinite words.
eHOA is HOA extended to record which atomic propositions are controllable, thus supporting synthesis.

## Splitting of the automaton

We use splitting of the parity automaton to a game using BDDs.
We use a variable ordering with uncontrollable APs before controllable APs.
For each state p, we do the following:
1. create an MTBDD encoding all transitions from p, where we encode the target state q and a priority in the MTBDD leaves.
2. create a set containing the unique MTBDDs for every valuation to uncontrollable variables (using straightforward enumeration in Sylvan)
3. for every unique MTBDD, compute all unique (priority, target state) pairs.
4. create a vertex owned by player 0 for every unique (priority, target state) pair, with the given priority, and the target state as successor state
5. create a vertex owned by player 0 for every MTBDD of step 3; from here, player 0 (controller) can choose any of the successor vertices created in step 4.
6. create a vertex owned by player 1 corresponding to p; from here, player 1 (environment) can choose any of the successor vertices created in step 5.

All vertices have priority 0 except for full-valuation vertices which have the priority (i.e. acceptance set) of the automaton's transition + 2. (The cases for min and odd parity automata are similar.)

## StarExec support

For the [SYNTCOMP competition](http://www.syntcomp.org/), the `prepare_se.sh` script prepares a gzipped tarball `knor.tar.gz` which can be uploaded to the StarExec environment.
